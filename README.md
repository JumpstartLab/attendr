# Attendr

A simple way to track attendance.

## Requirements

1. Load a CSV of registrant data
2. Dashboard interface needs to be used from an iPad
3. just scroll, find a name, and check it off
4. Data export back to CSV with check-in status

## Nice to have:

- Counts of currently checked-in and left to check-in
- AJAX updates
- Live updates as other checkers check someone
